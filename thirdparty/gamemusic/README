Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s running under DOS.

This is libgamemusic, one component of the Camoto suite.  libgamemusic is a
library that can read and write many different music file formats, with a focus
on formats used by DOS games.

The library exposes each file format as a long list of "events", such as
note-on, tempo change, pitch bend, and so on.  This event list can then be
manipulated if required, and then written out to a music file in the same or
another format.

An instrument list is also provided, which allows manipulation of each
instrument used in the song.  Current instrument types are General MIDI (patch
numbers), OPL register values (used by Adlib songs) and sampled instruments
(as used by mod/tracker formats.)

File formats from the following games are supported:

  * Bio Menace (.imf)
  * Blake Stone (.wlf)
  * Commander Keen (.imf)
  * Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures (.imf)
  * Drum Blaster (early .cmf)
  * Duke Nukem II (.imf)
  * God of Thunder (song*, *song)
  * Jill of the Jungle (.cmf)
  * Kiloblaster (.cmf)
  * Major Stryker (.wlf)
  * Math Rescue (.cmf)
  * Monster Bash (.imf)
  * Operation Body Count (.wlf)
  * Scud Atak (.cmf)
  * Solar Winds (.cmf)
  * Traffic Department 2192 (.cmf)
  * Wacky Wheels (.klm) [partial]
  * Wolfenstein 3-D (.wlf)
  * Word Rescue (.cmf) [partial]
  * Xargon (.cmf)
  * Zone 66 CDFM (.670)

These auxiliary file formats have also been implemented:

  * DOSBox raw OPL (.dro, v1 and v2)
  * Instrument Bank (.ibk)
  * Type-0/single-track MIDI (.mid)
  * RDOS raw OPL (.raw)

Many more formats are planned.

The library is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

You will need libgamecommon installed first.  If you downloaded the git
release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.  You can also run
"make check" to compile and run the tests.

This distribution includes an example program "gamemus" which serves as both
a command-line interface to the library as well as an example of how to use
the library.  This program is installed as part of the "make install" process.
See "man gamemus" for full details.

All supported music file formats are fully documented on the ModdingWiki - see

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.
